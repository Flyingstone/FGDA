# An Adversarial Domain Adaptation Network for Cross-Domain Fine-Grained Recognition

For NeurIPS 2019 < An Adversarial Domain Adaptation Network for Cross-Domain Fine-Grained Recognition>, submission 2217.

We add extra details of our paper in this repository containing the following aspects:
+ Experiments details and source codes,
+ Download ***MegRetail*** dataset and other two datasets.

##  Experiments details and source codes

We use [PyTorch 1.0](https://pytorch.org), CUDA 10.0 and Python 3.6 in all of our experiments. Tested on a 12CPU machine with 1xGPU NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti running Ubuntu 16 LTS.

Source Codes are available in [./Source_Codes](https://github.com/Anonymous2019NeurIPS/FGDA/tree/master/Source_Codes).

##  Download ***MegRetail*** dataset and other two datasets

###**MegRetail** consisting of 52,011 images of 263 fine-grained classes from 3 domains.

Lately, MegRetail will be released here!
###Office and GSV Cars

Also, for convenience, we provide the links of two dataset used in evaluation, ***Office*** and ***GSV Cars***.
